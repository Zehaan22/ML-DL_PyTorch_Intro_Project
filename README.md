# ML-DL_PyTorch_Intro_Project

My exploratory project into deep learning using PyTorch

### Topics

This project was mainly aimed at exploring the core fundamentals of Machine Learning using tenors and Torch as a library. The topics that we covered as a whole are:

1. Fundametals of Pytorch
2. Training Basic regression Models
3. Training a binary neural network (Essentially multiple regresssion)
4. Trainign a complete multiclass classification model from scratch
